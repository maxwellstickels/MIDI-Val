*_This is just the sources I recall, not a comprehensive list. There were another few websites I stumbled upon early into the project for medieval music rules + MIDI formatting that I got notes and/or ideas from, but neglected to store the links for and have not found. I also referenced a few of the BASH scripts I made for my current internship._
